HSU offers test optional admission. With these changes, students will be reviewed by HSU admissions in a way that benefits students the most. If you’ve taken more than one test, submit them all to HSU and we will evaluate your best possible score by superscoring. If you’ve taken the ACT once and the SAT once, we will look at your total scores for both tests and determine which of the two tests is your best one. If you’ve taken either ACT, SAT, or CLT more than once, we will look at all the subtests for a test type and create a superscore for you. Beginning September 2020, ACT will allow students to retake a single subtest (after previously taking the entire test). And yes, we will take those single subtest scores into consideration for your superscore calculation as well. It means students have a choice of whether or not they want a test score to be reviewed along with their application for admission. Students will be able to indicate their preference regarding test scores on their application. HSU will honor that preference when we review your application and high school transcript. Choose the option that you think shows HSU the best picture of you as a student. If you have not yet taken an ACT, SAT, or CLT and you don’t plan to take a test, choose test optional. If you’ve already taken a test and are satisfied with your score, choose to be reviewed with your test score. We understand that many juniors and seniors submit scores before they apply. That’s no problem. Just indicate on your application that you want to be reviewed without a test score and we will honor that, even if we have already received a test from you.

The mission of Hardin-Simmons University is to be a community dedicated to providing excellence in education enlightened by Christian faith and values. Hardin-Simmons University will be an innovative community of servant scholars engaging the minds and nurturing the spirits of future Christian leaders. Adopted by the HSU Board of Trustees on November 3, 2022 After much prayer and careful deliberation, this Statement of Faith humbly and thoughtfully memorializes the sincere historically held religious beliefs of Hardin-Simmons University. The institution remains committed to providing excellence in education enlightened by Christian faith and values. We desire to love everyone as God loves us. Hardin-Simmons will continue to welcome students from diverse backgrounds and experiences and encourage them to pursue excellence in education and grow in the knowledge and practice of God’s Word expressed in the Holy Bible. This Statement of Faith directs all facets of the governance, administration, management, operation, and employment practices of the university. While we want students to become knowledgeable of world views and perspectives on faith and life, the education and discipleship provided to students by the university must advance our Vision and Mission and not conflict with this Statement of Faith. Jesus Christ We believe in Jesus Christ, the Word become flesh, fully God and fully human, who died for us and was raised from the dead and ascended into heaven. Christ’s return will complete God’s redemptive mission. Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity.

(Psalm 139:14) Why did the Board of Trustees write a statement of faith? The members of the Board of Trustees are stewards of the vision and mission of the university, responsible for governing by setting policy and providing direction to the President to follow in leading the organization. We believe that a clearly defined statement of faith provides an essential point of reference for the fulfillment of these responsibilities. Why have a statement of faith? Hardin-Simmons University’s Statement of Faith clearly states the Christian beliefs that undergird and inform the university’s vision and mission, and highlights the principles that define what we envision in providing “excellence in education enlightened by Christian faith and values.” The Statement of Faith provides guidance to the university’s administrative leaders as they make decisions that impact every aspect of the institution. It also offers inspiration and a foundational point of reference to our faculty as they educate students and develop the next generation of leaders, as well as to our staff who provide the platforms that facilitate learning. Why publish the Statement of Faith now? As the nation’s cultural context changes in ways that with increasing frequency conflict with historic Christian teaching, we believe it is important that we expressly proclaim our beliefs earnestly and transparently as a university committed to providing excellence in education enlightened by Christian faith and values, as has been our purpose from inception of the university.

Established in 1891, Hardin-Simmons University is a pioneer of higher education in the West. Our founders dreamed of creating a place to nurture both the minds and spirits of our students. The city of Abilene was still in its infancy when a group of settlers—merchants, ranchers, and preachers—sought to found a college in this fledgling pioneer town. Through the tireless efforts of Rev. George W. Smith and attorney Kirwin Kade Legett, and the support of the Sweetwater Baptist Association, the school came into being February 18, 1891, as Abilene Baptist College. Abilene citizens joined the original trustees in raising $5,000 to initially fund the school. An Abilene businessman and his Fort Worth partners donated 16 acres and an additional $5,000. Plans were drawn and a building, Old Main, began to rise north of Abilene in the summer of 1891. New York preacher Dr. James B. Simmons provided funding to help the school complete construction of its first building. And the trustees honored him in renaming the institution Simmons College. The Simmons family continued to harbor a deep interest in the school, providing financial support and even requesting that they be buried in the midst of the campus. The first class of sixty students entered Simmons College in 1892. William Friley led the school as the first president. In the first 20 years, five presidents came and went. In 1909, Dr. J. D. Sandefer accepted the presidency. Under his 40-year leadership, the school grew and flourished. In 1925, the school became Simmons University. During the Great Depression, Simmons struggled, but financial help arrived when John and Mary Hardin of Burkburnet, Texas, donated part of their fortune to the school. The Hardins’ generosity and commitment brought the university long-term stability and, in 1934, a new name: Hardin-Simmons University. In 1926, Hardin-Simmons welcomed its first graduate program. In the 1960s, the campus expanded with a multi-million dollar campaign that results in a new library, science center, and a health and fitness complex. By the 80s, offered master’s degrees in six areas. Also in the 1980s, the school’s enrollment hit 2,000. By the 2000s, HSU grew to offer more than 50 majors, and was divided into distinct schools and colleges. We can't wait to see you at HSU! Click the button below and get started on your application.

HSU may be a relatively small school, but like larger Texas universities, we have big traditions that make us unique. They start with a Stampede and a beanie and end with a cap and gown. The world-famous Cowboy Band played its first note in 1923. Since then, this group of musicians has been an important part of HSU and regional celebrations. Each year, this Western-clad ensemble participates in parades, games, rodeos, and other performances on and off campus. The Band has traveled to more than a dozen countries and marched in the inaugural parades of six U.S. presidents: Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and George W. Bush. This esteemed parade unit got its start in the late 1920s when Will “Sheriff” Watson, a loyal HSU supporter, rode his white horse, Silver, at the head of our Cowboy Band during a parade. He was even dressed in Western gear to mirror the image of our famed music group. The tradition stuck, and Six White Horses was born; each rider carries a flag that has been flown over the state of Texas. Six White Horses participates in parades, rodeos, school visits, and other civic and community events. Each year, student-riders try out to be part of this elite, Western-style team. Dr. W.O. “Doc” Beazley directed the unit from 1962 to 1998, and during that time, he also author several books aimed at teaching children about horses, which used actual Six White Horses in the stories. You’re going to love STAMPEDE! This week-long introduction to HSU is full of fun and learning, from getting your iconic purple and gold beanie to participating in meals and games with your new classmates. This orientation program will help you transition into college life and into our welcoming campus community. You’ll meet upper-class students, faculty and staff members; learn about our traditions and history; and dive into the nuts and bolts of living and learning at HSU. HSU Anthem Hardin-Simmons, hail to thee, for famous are thy halls; Long may thy worth increase, long live thy noble cause.

We’re going to fight, fight, fight, We’re going to fight, fight, fight, For the glory of the Purple and Gold. Gilbert is a white goose that arrived on campus in spring 2013. He’s named after Gilbert Sandefer, son of former HSU President, Jefferson Davis Sandefer. As the unofficial mascot of HSU and adopted family member, he gets lots of attention from students, and we even celebrate his birthday annually. In 1916 Simmons College was graced with the introduction of Fritz, a white bulldog or large terrier (his heritage is unknown) that was owned by President Sandefer’s youngest son, Gib. Although his given name was Fritz, he soon earned another, more widely known moniker. There are speculative reasons for how he got the name Dam-it, from causing a cafeteria staff member to trip while carrying a tray full of food to students, or that it referenced his thoughts at losing his tail, either way the name stuck. Dam-it quickly became the class of 1920’s mascot as he grew up with the class, and integrated into the culture of the university. He was taught the ever-popular game of fetch with both rocks and sticks, and would carry the rocks around in his mouth wherever he went. Dam-it was allowed to roam all over campus, including classrooms, and laughter would ensue when he would fall asleep in class, the rock would tumble out of his mouth, startle him awake, and cause a commotion until he had secured the rock once more in his jaws. The story of Dam-it is however, a tragedy, as he contracted pneumonia in January of 1920 and died only a few hours later. How much of an impact he had on the university was on display at his funeral, which included a procession led by the Cowboy Band, four seniors as pallbearers, and grave dug by freshmen. Senior class chaplain Ira Harrison led the service speaking from the text “Every Dog has his Day.” Almost the entire student body and faculty were present for the funeral in the center of campus. The story was picked up by the Associated Press, and received national attention, with condolences coming from every part of the country. A marble tombstone was raised over his grave with the few words: Dam-it, He is Dead. Around 1950, a metal plate was put in place of the chipped stone, and at a later time the memorial was moved beside the Reflection Pond, and a purple and gold fire hydrant was established in his memory. After the death of Dam-it, the class of 1920 donated another canine mascot, this time a young Dalmatian, but Dam-it was irreplaceable. Although Dam-it has been gone from the campus of Hardin-Simmons University for over 90 years, his legacy lives on in the monument beside the pond, and in the fire hydrant featured on every school ring. Christmas season is a special time of year at HSU. Each year, we gather on Anderson Lawn to celebrate the lighting of the tree with a storybook, cookies, crafts, carols and cocoa. The festivities also include a dinner and a concert. HSU’s Class of 1919 made possible the Petrified Tree Stump which is situated across from Abilene Hall. It was taken from the sand beds in the vicinity of Clyde and was brought to the campus by the late D.Q. Riddle, editor of the Bronco and a member of the 1919 class. We can't wait to see you at HSU!

In the United States, Europe, Canada and beyond, the image brought to mind by the mention of Hardin-Simmons University is that of Western-style riders on White Horses. The Six White Horses have performed for millions in parades, rodeos and at many other public functions. While thousands see the horses at many public functions throughout the year, an important part of their work is visiting the area elementary schools. Each year, more than 15,000 children have the opportunity to sit on a White Horse. This opportunity has further developed an awareness of the program and a love for the Horses by children in the Big Country. “Doc” Beazley’s books, depicting the life of each horse, are an important part of many children’s treasures. In the late 1920s, Will “Sheriff” Watson, a loyal supporter of the University, decided to ride his white horse, Silver, at the head of the Cowboy Band in a parade. Attired in full Western dress to mirror the image of the Western-clad band members, Watson set an important pattern. The idea proved so popular that the famous Six White Horse parade unit was born. In 1962, Dr. W.O. “Doc” Beazley began directing the Six White Horses program. He came to HSU for the first time in 1948 and then returned in 1960 to serve in various teaching and administrative capacities. Beazley became a widely known author of 11 books teaching children to appreciate horses. After 36 years of dedication and commitment, Doc retired from his role as director of the Six White Horses program in 1998. Debbie Jones, the current director, took over the program in 1998. In order to be eligible for the Six White Horses team, a student must be currently attending Hardin-Simmons University and enrolled in at least twelve hours. Each September, prospective riders are required to participate in try-outs, in which a panel of judges rate each rider’s horsemanship, attitude, and appearance. The top eight riders are selected for the team. All returning riders are required to try out each year to ensure that the most qualified riders make up the team. Practices are normally held two to three times per week. We can't wait to see you at HSU! Click the button below and get started on your application.

“The World Famous” Cowboy Band, an ensemble rich in history and tradition, has been an important part of HSU, Abilene, and West-Texas since its inception in April 1923. Membership in the Cowboy Band is open to all HSU students, both men and women, with prior high school band experience. The band regularly performs for football and basketball games, rodeos, presidential and gubernatorial inaugurations, parades, and many other campus and civic events. Presenting some 35 performances annually, it is one of the most widely heard and seen musical ensembles in all of West Texas! As its name suggests, this highly spirited band has literally traveled the world entertaining audiences. It acquired the nick-name “World Famous” after its European Tour in 1930. Since that time it has performed in the Azores, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Monaco, Newfoundland, Spain, and Switzerland. The Cowboy Band has performed for six Presidential Inaugural Parades and events: Herbert Hoover – 1929, Franklin D. Roosevelt – 1941, Dwight D. Eisenhower – 1953, Richard M. Nixon – 1969, Jimmy Carter – 1977, and George W. Bush – 2001. The Band has also performed for 11 Texas Gubernatorial Parades and events. Recent travel has included performances in Boston for the Lion’s International Convention and at the San Francisco Pow Wow, one of the world’s largest tourism conventions, at the request of Governor Rick Perry. The Cowboy Band dresses in colorful western attire that has changed little over the past 91 years. It was back in 1923 that Grady Kinsolving, secretary of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce, approached Simmons College band director Dewey O. Wiley, and asked the band to represent Abilene at a West Texas Chamber of Commerce gathering in San Angelo, quite an honor considering that the little band had previously ventured no further than the towns of Baird, Tuscola, and View. In looking for a distinctive yet affordable uniform, a visit to the local dry goods store turned up some chaps, hats, and neckerchiefs. The Cowboy Band was born! What is it that makes the Hardin-Simmons University Cowboy Band so memorable and unique in the entire band world? It isn’t the band’s size – the band typically numbers between 40 and 55. It isn’t fancy uniforms – the band wears traditional western attire. And it isn’t a strict military regimen, that’s for sure! Why does the Cowboy Band thrill audiences whenever and wherever it performs? While most bands are satisfied with performing for others, the Cowboy Band does more. It works hard to engage its audiences on an individual and personal level. It joins in the celebration! This characteristic, coupled with the world’s fascination with the free-spirited cowboy of the American West, may account for its popularity wherever it goes! The band’s largest audiences are generally at parades. The Cowboy Band annually marches in the Dallas Children’s Medical Center Holiday Parade (previously the Adolphus Parade). In this parade alone, the band will perform for more than a half-million people along the parade route. It is also broadcast in more than 30-million homes across North America. While marching at a super-fast cadence of 200-210 beats per minute the band shuffles into view, whooping, hollering, and waving their hats in the air! Their leather chaps move in smooth unison as the band seems to float along. Suddenly two band members break rank and join arms to “swing-your- partner” square dance style. Occasionally, a band member my stop to greet bystanders by moving through the crowd shaking hands. Another may borrow a chair to sit for a second and fan her hot feet with her hat. Along the way the band strives to make eye contact with everyone on the parade route. Soon the drum major gives the signal and the band begins playing The Eyes of Texas, Anthem March, Hey Baby, or Jingle Bells, swaying back and forth with the music. Periodically, they come to a complete stop with a huge stomp and begin a series of four giant scissor-kicks which crisscross each other. Known as the “cow-step,” this spectacular maneuver always elicits cheers from the audience. With chaps flying, instruments flashing, and general “carrying-on” during each kick it is an impressive site! Suddenly a whistle blows and the band whirls back into its rapid cadence, holding hats aloft and whistling and hollering with irresistible enthusiasm! This infectious enthusiasm is present in all of the band’s many performances! It’s Cowboy Band Show Time! Smiles abound! Memories are made! We can't wait to see you at HSU!

Sponsor a Christlieb Student The Christlieb (German for “Christ’s love”) Program reflects the desire of HSU founder, James B. Simmons, to show Christ’s love to all students. Through this new program, orphan students can attend HSU with their tuition paid for by a sponsor. These orphan students have either had their parents die, have been permanently abandoned by their parents, or their parents are unknown. James 1:27 (NIV) says, “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” While not every homeless student is an orphan, students who classify as independent do not have a family member’s support to attend college. As a Christian university, it is our mission not only to educate students who can afford it but to support those who cannot. Perhaps you are not in a position to adopt a child into your home, but you have been blessed with financial resources to “adopt” a student by supporting their desire for a Christian education. Sponsors can support a student for their entire tuition, or they will be matched with other donors to meet the students’ needs together. To donate any amount to the program click the button below.
