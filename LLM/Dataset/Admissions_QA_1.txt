Q: What type of information do I need to provide to HSU in my application?
A: HSU requires each applicant to submit certain documents to be considered for admission.  Below you will find a list of required documents HSU Admissions Office will need so that your application can be reviewed for admission.
    • A transcript from your high school.  The transcript must include your name, school name, completed coursework, including grades, through your junior year, GPA, and class rank.  If you are homeschooled, please see a sample homeschool transcript, to assist with HSU requirements.
    • Your ACT, SAT, or CLT score (if applicable). The writing portion is not required. Please be advised that self-reported scores may be used for an admission decision, but a verified score will need to be submitted prior to registration for classes.  Any variance in self-reported and verified score may affect your admission status and/or scholarship award.
Besides these documents, the application on the main HSU website will ask for information related to your academic plans (if you would like to attend in person or online, which program of study you would like to pursue, which term would you like to begin your studies, etc), your personal background information (name, address, contact information), your family, your academic history, your test scores (if applicable), any activities and distinctions you performed (any leadership roles, club memberships, community involvement, volunteer work, awards, and distinctions you'd like the university to know), and some other questions (disciplinary history, if you are a veteran, etc). 

Q: Are there any requirements to get admitted at HSU for a first-time freshman?

Automatic general admission will be offered to any student with one of the following qualifications:
    • A Composite ACT score of 20 or higher
    • A Combined SAT score of 1030 or higher
    • A CLT score of 66 or higher
    • A high school GPA of 3.5 or higher
    • A high school class rank within the top 25% in a class of 10 or more
Students meeting general admission requirements will receive notification within 5 business days of receiving all required documents.
Automatic enhanced admission will be offered to students who do not submit a qualifying test score but can show either of the following:
    • A high school GPA greater than or equal to 3.0, but less than 3.5
    • A high school class rank between the 26th and 50th percentile in a class of 10 or more
*Students with enhanced admission are enrolled in the Strategic Learning Initiative in addition to regular coursework in their first semester at Hardin-Simmons University

Q: Do I need to take a college entrance exam to be admitted?
A: No. While HSU recommends you take a college entrance exam, or submit the scores you already have, HSU will accept applications without test scores, with no penalty to the student. HSU will continue to have a holistic application review process and will consider all submitted application items when making an admission decision.
Students who indicate on their application without test scores will be reviewed for admission based of their transcript only. Students who indicate on their application with test scores will be reviewed with their test score as well as their transcript for admission. Test scores will be “superscored” if they submit more than one test. 

Q: What is the Strategic Learning Initiative?
A: The Strategic Learning Initiative consists of:
    • A one hour credit course that meets 2 times per week.  In each class period, twenty minutes will be spent introducing a learning strategy, and thirty minutes to helping the student apply the strategy to other courses
    • A weekly 30-minute meeting one-on-one with a SLI Instructor or academic coach

Q: Does HSU have a preference for which test score I should submit? SAT, ACT, CLT, or other type of exam?
A: No, there is no preferable exam. If you are having trouble choosing a college entrance exam to take or submit, HSU recommends you contact your high school counselor or choose the exam that best you.

Q: Do I have a time limit between my application and when the year I finished high school for my transcript to be acceptable?
A: No. Independently of when you finish high school, your transcript is valid for application.

Q: Does Hardin-Simmons University change any fees to apply?
A: Domestic students are no required to pay any fees to apply for Hardin-Simmons.

Q: When filling my application to HSU, I came across a question about disciplinary probation. What does that mean? What is considered disciplinary probation at HSU?
A: The keyword if you should or should not answer this question with a “yes” or a “no” is if your actions in another institution resulted in suspension. Nevertheless, the application will be reviewed and counselors from HSU may ask questions to ensure that you are eligible to attend the university and that no mistakes were made when applying (like the accident of answering the question with a “yes” by mistake).
