Q: Can a resident change rooms after school starts?
A: A resident can request to change rooms or to move to a different building or hall. Before the 8th class day, any resident can request to change buildings. Inside their building, a resident can request to change rooms if needed, given specific situations like roommate conflict. The Residence Life Office prefers that any request to change rooms happen within the first two weeks of residency. If the request to move is accepted, the resident can move to a different room or building once, and then, cannot request again for the rest of the semester. 

Q: Are there exceptions for when a student living in residence halls can move to the university apartments?
A: Yes. If there are many available rooms in the apartments, the Residence Life Office can invite students who already lived 3 semesters in the residence halls to move to the apartments, allowing them to skip the requirement to live 4 semesters in the residence halls.

Q: How can a student move to the university apartments?
A: The apartments are for upperclassmen. To live in the apartments, residents must fulfill the following requirements:
    • They must have lived at least 4 semesters in residence halls, or be 21 years old.
    • If a student transfers to the university and lived on-campus during his time in the other university, those semesters he lived on campus count for him to fulfill the 4 semesters required in residence halls to live in the apartments.

Q: How does HSU Residency treat students with disability?
A: All the buildings next semester will meet ADA standards. Students with disabilities are still required to stay in the resident halls for their first 4 semesters. However, if necessary, they can be moved to the apartments to better accommodate their needs. Besides that, students can get medical accommodations to live on campus, but first, they need to go through Disability Services.

Q: Is it allowed to have pets on campus? If yes, which pets are allowed?
A: No pets are allowed to live on campus, except for fish in 5-gallon tanks or smaller, and Emotional Support Animals. However, ESAs are only allowed if approved by Disability Services and Residence Life. For more information, access https://www.hsutx.edu/academics/academic-resources/disability-services/emotional-support-animal-information/ 

Q: Is there any exceptions for students that are part of the LGBTQ community?
A: Rules to live on campus and for visitation are the same for students that are part of the LGBTQ community. For example, when a student is visiting a building exclusive for the same sex, he/she does not need to be checked in by any Resident assistant or Director. It is important to highlight that all sexual activities on campus are forbidden. 
Any conflicts between residents that involve any beliefs or activities related to the LGBTQ community will be handled similarly to any other conflict related to residents and students (the officers will sit down and talk to both parties, trying to come up with the most fair and pleasurable solution in respect to the rules of the university and the Student Handbook).
